# 3D Spinner Clock

A 3D clock coded in Javascript. Uses OBJ 3D models rendered in WebGL to create an animated clock using easing functions.

A custom Python script was used within Blender to create and export alphanumeric characters as OBJ 3D model files.

The p5.js library is used to import the OBJ models and render them using WebGL to create an animated 3D clock.

An quadratic easing function is used to create the 'bounce' when each ring rotates.
